# Portfolio + Blog CMS
### This projects consists of a blog content management system integrated within my portfolio website. 

## Features

- Facilitates creating, updating, and deleting posts

- Enables a user to create a post in markdown format, which is then rendered as normal Html on the frontend.

- Allows users to create accounts, which can then be used to manage their posts. This being a personal project, i did not add a feature to allow users to manage their account since this will be be used by me.
